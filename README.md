Project Title: YouTube ASMR Data Mining

Team Members: Emma Crawford

Description of the project: 

Summary of the question(s) sought and answers:

My project will attempt answer three key questions. Firstly, what factors have the most significant impact on the monetization potential of YouTube videos in the US? Secondly, how do engagement metrics, such as likes, dislikes, comments, and subscriber count, affect audience retention and viewer loyalty? Finally, are there specific content genres or categories that consistently perform well in terms of views, audience, and revenue generation? By addressing these questions, I can make data-driven decisions to improve my content, engage my viewers effectively, and maximize monetization on YouTube.
