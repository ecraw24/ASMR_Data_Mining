# YouTube ASMR Data Mining
Team Members: Emma Crawford
Completed: August 14th, 2023

## Description of the project 

With this project, I hoped to discover the key factors that determine the view count and overall popularity of YouTube videos in the ASMR niche. ASMR (Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response) is a form of content that uses high quality sound and pleasant objects to provide relaxing or sleep-inducing content to viewers. As someone aspiring to create YouTube content as an income stream, understanding the elements that contribute to video success is one of the first steps in deciding what to create. By analyzing a dataset of ASMR YouTube videos, I learned about optimizing content creation strategies using Linear Regression, Random Forest Models, and K-Means Clustering as well as web scraping and APIs. 

## Questions 

Firstly, what factors have the most significant impact on the monetization potential of YouTube videos in the US? Secondly, how do engagement metrics, such as likes, dislikes, comments, and subscriber count, affect audience retention and viewer loyalty? Finally, are there specific content genres or categories that consistently perform well in terms of views, audience, and revenue generation? By addressing these questions, I can make data-driven decisions to improve my content, engage my viewers effectively, and maximize monetization on YouTube.

### Answers/Recommendations 

1. Likes and comments are the best predictors of view count
2. Subscriber count is the next best predictor of view count
3. Post your video on a Sunday between 6am and 3pm CDT; If you are busy on Sundays, try to still post your video in this time frame during the week
4. Focus on sleep and massage content
5. Use approximately 20 tags per video
6. Create a title with approximately 10 words
7. Write long descriptions to describe your channel, content, and social media links
8. Aim for longer videos, if possible
9. Remove old videos

## Application of this knowledge 

For a YouTube content creator in the niche of ASMR without personal identifying information and in the category of relaxation (not food, animals, or role-play), this knowledge will assist with monetization and channel growth.
